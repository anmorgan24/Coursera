    "- You can look at Production Machine Learning as both Machine Learning itself, and the knowledge and skils required in modern Software Development\n",
    "- If you're working on a Machine Learning team in industry, you really need expertise in both Machine Learning and Software to be successful. This is because your team will not just be producing a single result, you'll be developing a product or service that will operate continuously and may be a mission critical part of your company's work\n",
    "- Oftentimes the most challenging aspects of building machine learning systems turn out to be the things you least expected, like deployment. It's all very well being able to build a model, but getting that into people's hands and seeing how they use it can be very eye-opening\n",

    "- **QPS = Queries Per Second**\n",
    "- In speech recognition applications, it's not unusual to aim to get a response back to the user within half a second, or 500 ms.\n",
    "    - Of this 500ms budget, you may be able to allocate 300ms to your speech recognition task; this gives a latency requirement for your system\n",
    "    - **Throughput** refers to \"how many queries per second do you need to handle, given your compute resources?\" (maybe given a certain number of cloud servers)\n",
    "- **Logging:** When building your system, it may be useful to log as much of the data for analysis and review as well as to provide more data for retraining your learning algorithm in the future\n",
