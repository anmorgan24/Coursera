    "- You can look at Production Machine Learning as both Machine Learning itself, and the knowledge and skils required in modern Software Development\n",
    "- If you're working on a Machine Learning team in industry, you really need expertise in both Machine Learning and Software to be successful. This is because your team will not just be producing a single result, you'll be developing a product or service that will operate continuously and may be a mission critical part of your company's work\n",
    "- Oftentimes the most challenging aspects of building machine learning systems turn out to be the things you least expected, like deployment. It's all very well being able to build a model, but getting that into people's hands and seeing how they use it can be very eye-opening\n",
